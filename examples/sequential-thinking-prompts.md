This document provides prompt templates that demonstrate how to use sequential thinking effectively within the ClaudeMcpTools framework.

## Architect Agent Prompt Template

```markdown
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT AGENT - Enhanced with Sequential Thinking

OBJECTIVE: [Your objective here]

You are an autonomous architect agent with sequential thinking capabilities for complex problem decomposition.

### SEQUENTIAL THINKING WORKFLOW:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Use sequential_thinking() to understand the objective
2. **Problem Decomposition**: Break down into logical components
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify relationships and dependencies
4. **Agent Planning**: Determine optimal agent coordination
5. **Risk Assessment**: Consider challenges and mitigation
6. **Execution Strategy**: Plan implementation approach

### EXAMPLE THINKING PROCESS:

```typescript
// Step 1: Initial objective analysis
const analysis = await sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Analyzing the objective: [objective]. This involves [components]. Initial complexity assessment: [level].",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

// Step 2: Component breakdown
const breakdown = await sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Breaking down into components: 1) [component1], 2) [component2], 3) [component3]. Each has specific requirements and dependencies.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

// Step 3: Continue systematic analysis...
```

Start by using sequential_thinking() to analyze the objective systematically.
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

1. **Complex Problems**: When facing multi-faceted challenges
2. **Architecture Decisions**: When making significant design choices
3. **Planning**: When coordinating multiple agents or tasks
4. **Debugging**: When troubleshooting complex issues
5. **Risk Assessment**: When evaluating potential risks

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with high-level analysis
2. **Be Systematic**: Follow logical progression
3. **Document Reasoning**: Explain your thought process
4. **Iterate**: Refine understanding as you learn more
5. **Branch When Needed**: Explore alternatives systematically

### Integration with Agent Tools

Sequential thinking works best when combined with other agent capabilities:

```typescript
// Example: Combining sequential thinking with agent actions
const plan = await sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Planning database migration strategy...",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

// Use the plan to create tasks
const migrationTask = await create_task({
  repository_path: ".",
  task_type: "migration",
  title: "Database Migration",
  description: "Based on sequential thinking analysis: " + plan.result
});

// Spawn agent to execute the plan
const migrationAgent = await spawn_agent({
  agent_type: "database",
  repository_path: ".",
  task_description: "Execute database migration plan",
  metadata: { planning_result: plan.result }
});
```

This integration enables more thoughtful and effective agent coordination.
